# anti-plagiarism-app prototype by ComboMeal Software

It's a prototype for an app to analyze source code for plagiarism. The analyzation is done by tokenizing source code and then analyzing tokens with W-Shingling and / or calculating the Levenshtein distance using the Wagnerâ€“Fischer algorithm. (There's also an experimental function that uses function signatures)
